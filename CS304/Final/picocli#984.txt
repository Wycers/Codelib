What does it look like?

The @filename entry in the usage help is listed under positional parameters, but when there are no other positional parameters, the Parameters heading won't be shown.

Why did that happen?
@filename is a positional parameter but it doesn't appear in positionalParameterList because it is introduced by the atFileInUsage argument. When @filename is the only parameter, positionalParameterList is to be empty. In that situation, the heading will not be shown but the parameter list will be.

How to fix it?
When judge whether to output the heading or not, consider is there any parameters aside from the list. Because the @filename is the only parameter can be aside from the list. So add the logic: if there is atFileParameter, output the corresponding heading.

Besides, extract the logic to a method hasAtFileParameterList to enhance code reuse.
