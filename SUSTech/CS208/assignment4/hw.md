## Problem 1

### Description

 Foreachofthefollowingtwostatements,decidewhetheritistrueorfalse. If it is true, give a short explanation. If it is false, give a counterexample. 

1. Suppose we are given an instance of the Minimum Spanning Tree Problem on a graph $G$, with edge costs that are all positive and distinct. Let $T$ be a minimum spanning tree for this instance. Now suppose we replace each edge cost $c_e$ by its square, $$c_e^2$$, thereby creating a new instance of the problem with the same graph but different costs. 

   True or false? $T$ must still be a minimum spanning tree for this new instance. 

2. Suppose we are given an instance of the Shortest $s$-$t$ Path Problem on a directed graph $G$. We assume that all edge costs are positive and distinct. Let $P$ be a minimum-cost $s$-$t$ path for this instance. Now suppose we replace each edge cost $c_e$ by its square, $c^2_e​$, thereby creating a new instance of the problem with the same graph but different costs. 

   True or false? $P$ must still be a minimum-cost $s$-$t$ path for this new instance.

### Solution



## Problem 2

### Description

Suppose you are given a connected graph $G$, with edge costs that are all distinct. Prove that $G​$ has a unique minimum spanning tree.

## Solution



## Problem 3

### Description

Consider the Minimum Spanning Tree Problem on an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, with a cost $c_e ≥0$ on each edge, where the costs may not all be different. If the costs are not all distinct, there can in general be many distinct minimum-cost solutions. Suppose we are given a spanning tree $T ⊆E$ with the guarantee that for every $e∈T$, $e$ belongs to some minimum-cost spanning tree in $G$. Can we conclude that $T$ itself must be a minimum-cost spanning tree in $G​$? Give a proof or a counterexample with explanation.
