% 10 points (50D each) & corresponding fitnesses given to assist verification for code translation for function 1. 
% Variables:x1, line1-line10
% Corresponding Function Values: f1, line11-line20

test_data_func2.mat
% 10 points (50D each) & corresponding fitnesses given to assist verification for code translation for function 2. 
% Variables:x2, line1-line10
% Corresponding Function Values: f2, line11-line20

test_data_func25.mat
% 10 points (50D each) & corresponding fitnesses given to assist verification for code translation for function 25. 
% Variables:x25, line1-line10
% Corresponding Function Values: f25, line11-line20

***Notice, for function 4,17,24,25, since they have noise, please set noise to 0 (e.g setting 0.0*N(0,1)) before test.

%all 25 global optima for the 25 global optima,
% line1:global optimum for the function 1, line2:global optimum for the function 2,..., line25:global optimum for the function 25
% please notice, function 5,8,20 set the global optima on the bounds, so the corresponding global optima are

NOTICE:
hybrid_func1_M_D......matrix data in matlab contain a structure M, and M.M1,M.M2...M.M10 are ten D*D matrix
But  hybrid_func1_M_D......matrix data in ASCII 's structure is different.
